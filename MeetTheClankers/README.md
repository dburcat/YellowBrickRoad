## Meet The Clankers

One of the tools you'll be using a lot of in this course is a Large Language Model.
(Think like ChatGPT).

But like everything, us programmers have special tools here too.

AND to help you get moving on some things, you need to write an AI Profile.

This a document that you can paste into an AI to let it know who you are, er, maybe, er, _what you are_.

An AI Profile lets the LLM know what you know-ish and who you are-ish and how it should explain thing to you.

Maybe Like: 

```
You are a patient teacher very skilled at explaining things to an adult learner.

I am an experienced retail worker, some who has years of experience in
retailing in consumer electronics.
I have a associate's degree in management froma  community college.

I am a high school graduate. I enjoy working on cars, playing video
games and cooking for friends and family.

As I ask you questions in this session, use what you know about me to explain
things in terms of my experiences.
Use metaphors and examples that make sense to me, in order fo me to learn the things
I ask about as fast as I can.
```

This kind of personalized profile will help a lots when you start asking an AI/LLM to explain things to you.
You usually only have to add this to the beginning of a conversations ession with an LLM, 
not every time you ask a questions or seek an explanation.

Put the file "ai-profile" on the desk top of your mac... (depending on how much personal 
information you put in the file, you probably don't want to add it to this repo and commit to github.)

TODO: add some "explain it to me" prompts.
