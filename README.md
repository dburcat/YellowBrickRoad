# YellowBrickRoad (Week 1)

_week 1 of ZCW_

Welcome to our first weekly project, **Yellow Brick Road**. This project is designed to help you get started with the basics of programming and the tools you'll need to succeed in your career as a developer. We'll be covering everything from setting up your development environment to writing your first program.

Working through a series of labs, and completing challenges, is what you are aiming to get done this week.

## Projects

All of you will be working on the following projects:

### All Projects

Projects inside this repo.
They are not really language (java/python) dependent.

- ZipCode-GettingStarted : lets make sure there are, well, you know, things
- Meet the Clankers : Do Your AI Profile
- `zipcode.rocks` : heh, heh, heh, the Domain
- FirstRepo : git yourself goin'
- Shell-Terminal the magic spell machine
- NanoEditor believe it or not, it's all about the TEXT
- [CodeGo](https://github.com/ZipCodeCore/CodeGo.git) objects and interpreters
- DreamHouse show me your domestic aspirations

Some of these have both Java and Python parts to them. 
You will do one or the other.

### Apps

- **Tasking** : your organizational app
- **ZipShell** : oh you're not done with this one
